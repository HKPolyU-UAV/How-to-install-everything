# Ubuntu Installation
To begin with, we need a bootalbe USB drive to install ubuntu on laptops/desktops. Below shows how to do so:</br>
1. prepare a thumbdrive with 8Gb at least.</br>
2. go to here and downlolad [rufus](https://rufus.ie/en/), where the software helps with creating bootable USB flash drives.</br>
3. visit [here](https://releases.ubuntu.com/) for ubuntu releases, click on the desired release version to download the iso file. (currently, we suggest 18.04)</br>
4. with step 2 and step 3 being followed, launch the rufus software:</br></br>![alt text](https://github.com/HKPolyU-UAV/How-to-install-everything/blob/main/medias/rufus.png)</br></br>
5. on the "Device" drop down, select the thumbdrive. </br>
6. on "Boot selection", select the downloaded iso file.</br>
7. and click on "start". </br></br>

After the bootable stick is successfully created, now shutdown your computer.<br/>
1. Restart and enter BIOS menu. (it differs from computer to computer, usually depends on comps brand)<br/>
2. modify the boot priority to your bootable stick. </br>
3. your computer should now enter ubuntu desktop image. </br>
4. follow the instruction, should be easy. </br>
5. click on install third party drivers. </br>
6. for the allocation of drive space. if ubuntu succesfully detects other OS, there should be option "install ubuntu alongside another operating system". </br>
7. else, click on "something else", and alocate drive space manually. </br>
8. Please be cautious when allocating your drive space, as you would not want to erase you Windows accidentally. </br>
9. This tutorial page only serves as a reference and **would not** bear any responsibilities if things go south during the installation.</br>
10. set login details, easy password is recommended, as the password will be repeatedly used during installation of other things.</br>
11. After everything is set (**look before you leap!!!**), now click on install. </br></br>

After all the installation is done, remove the USB. If your computer is equipped with ubuntu and windows simultaneously, enter BIOS menu page to set boot priority. </br></br>
If the belowed desktop image is seen, ubuntu 18.04 is good to go on your computer.</br></br></br>
